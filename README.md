## General info
This project is a GUI application that uses JavaFX libraries and SceneBuilder to help create a fully functional custom web browser that can run directly through your terminal. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java
* JDK version: 17
* JavaFX
* SceneBuilder
* IntelliJ IDEA

## Functionality
I used SceneBuilder to create a layout of the web browser and attached methods I've created to each container and control. I've set Google as my default web engine/homepage. <b />
Each button located on the menubar is fully functional.
* File - a functional menu button that has a dropdown menu that gives you the options to zoom in or zoom out when those buttons are pressed
  * Zoom in - a functional menu button located in the File button dropdown menu, which allows you to zoom in for better visibility when clicked
  * Zoom out - a functional menu button located in the File button dropdown menu, which allows you to zoom in for better visibility when clicked
* History - a functional menu button that has a drop down menu that allows you to click a "View History" button, which prints a list of recently visited webpages
* Bookmarks - a functional menu button that has a drop down menu that lists popular pages I've set that redirect you to their associated websites
* " < " - a functional menu button that allows you to go back to the previous page you've visited
* " > " - a functional menu button that allows you to go forward to the following page you've left
* Refresh - a functional menu button that allows you to refresh the page
